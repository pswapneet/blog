      <description>Cringelife has made anxiety and random cringing at snap flashbacks a reality. The goal is to be less cringe, or to at least not have the anxiety. The productivity is quite low still, I am making a website for someone and it is going OK. I do not know why I pay railway to host on them. It seems I could host this blog for free on Cloudflare Pages. Maybe I can start using Railway more, get my $5/month worth.</description>

      <description>The blog is redployed again. My Railway account changed. Planning some changes. Trying to make it less cringe. Layout is not the best still. If for whatever reason you want to contact me, send me an email: pswapneet@gmail.com. Do not contact me on Twitter or Discord, I am not active there at all. Might get back on Discord, but Twitter (X) I will probably not use at all.</description>

      <title>Python Speech to Text using OpenAI API, Gradio, and PyAutoGUI</title>
      <link>https://nginx-production-66da.up.railway.app/posts/speech2text/</link>

      <description>Here are the steps to install the Speech to Text Python program:
  Make sure that you have Python3 and pip installed on your system.
  Visit https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys and make an API Key if you do not have one. Note that you have to activate a payment method too because the API is not free, although it is reasonably priced (1hr of transcription will cost you $0.36 at the moment of writing this.</description>

      <description>Sunday, Funday I keep working on it. There has been a lot happening in the AI/LLM space this past week as you all know, and I intend to use this to escape manual labor as much as possible. I know that it is possible, but one step at a time, so I have been doing some automation using Python and planning on how to proceed. More on that in the coming week, for now, I must sleep to get ready for another Manic Monday.</description>

      <description>2023 has been unusually productive so far! The fun work train just keeps on rollin&#39; (David Lynch reference, is he still on YouTube?) with no signs of derailment. Railway references aside, I have not been deploying on railway.app so far this year (well, I tried to deploy Flask there, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out how to get it to work), but rather on pythonanywhere.com. More on my dev projects later in the week, I want to start out the week with some good ol&#39; fashion meme posting, or whatever you call it.</description>

      <description>Hurry, need to make a post before 2022 is over! I know I said I was going to maintain this blog. I did not do that. Ok so thankfully this year is almost over since it has been quite bad for many reasons.
I have not been doing any web dev at all during the fall or winter. In fact I had to google how to make a post since I forgot ($ hugo new posts/nameofpost.</description>

      <description>The blog is online again I was too lazy to do it quick The summer is almost over and I have to start being productive again. The blog was offline because of a change in my Railway.app account. It is now online again and I will update it at least twice a month to update about things that I am working on. I promise not to be too lazy. First order of business should be to update the Links and the About page, and adding some images here and there.</description>

      <description>Instructions for Railway.app simple deployment! A quick update on how it is deployed and comments on the immediate future! I don&amp;rsquo;t need a database, so I use Hugo, and theme is called PaperMod. I would like a slightly different layout, but this will have to do for now since I need to work on other things than CSS. I will add some more graphics as soon as possible and update the About and Links page.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m working on it! A timeless phrase that all NEETs should always remember. Well, July is almost over, I said I was working on something, so here it is, it&amp;rsquo;s not much for now but it&amp;rsquo;s something. I&amp;rsquo;m learning the DevOps to get things as right as possible from the get-go.</description>
