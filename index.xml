      <description>Hurry, need to make a post before 2022 is over! I know I said I was going to maintain this blog. I did not do that. Ok so thankfully this year is almost over since it has been quite bad for many reasons.
I have not been doing any web dev at all during the fall or winter. In fact I had to google how to make a post since I forgot ($ hugo new posts/nameofpost.</description>

      <description>The blog is online again I was too lazy to do it quick The summer is almost over and I have to start being productive again. The blog was offline because of a change in my Railway.app account. It is now online again and I will update it at least twice a month to update about things that I am working on. I promise not to be too lazy. First order of business should be to update the Links and the About page, and adding some images here and there.</description>

      <description>Instructions for Railway.app simple deployment! A quick update on how it is deployed and comments on the immediate future! I don&amp;rsquo;t need a database, so I use Hugo, and theme is called PaperMod. I would like a slightly different layout, but this will have to do for now since I need to work on other things than CSS. I will add some more graphics as soon as possible and update the About and Links page.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m working on it! A timeless phrase that all NEETs should always remember. Well, July is almost over, I said I was working on something, so here it is, it&amp;rsquo;s not much for now but it&amp;rsquo;s something. I&amp;rsquo;m learning the DevOps to get things as right as possible from the get-go.</description>
