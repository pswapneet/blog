      <description>Cringelife has made anxiety and random cringing at snap flashbacks a reality. The goal is to be less cringe, or to at least not have the anxiety. The productivity is quite low still, I am making a website for someone and it is going OK. I do not know why I pay railway to host on them. It seems I could host this blog for free on Cloudflare Pages. Maybe I can start using Railway more, get my $5/month worth.</description>
