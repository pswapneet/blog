      <description>Instructions for Railway.app simple deployment! A quick update on how it is deployed and comments on the immediate future! I don&amp;rsquo;t need a database, so I use Hugo, and theme is called PaperMod. I would like a slightly different layout, but this will have to do for now since I need to work on other things than CSS. I will add some more graphics as soon as possible and update the About and Links page.</description>
