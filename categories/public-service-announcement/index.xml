      <description>The blog is online again I was too lazy to do it quick The summer is almost over and I have to start being productive again. The blog was offline because of a change in my Railway.app account. It is now online again and I will update it at least twice a month to update about things that I am working on. I promise not to be too lazy. First order of business should be to update the Links and the About page, and adding some images here and there.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m working on it! A timeless phrase that all NEETs should always remember. Well, July is almost over, I said I was working on something, so here it is, it&amp;rsquo;s not much for now but it&amp;rsquo;s something. I&amp;rsquo;m learning the DevOps to get things as right as possible from the get-go.</description>
