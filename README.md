This is my static personal blog, powered by Hugo, PaperMod theme, and Railway.app

2023, Oct. 22: Redeployed again.
================================
The npm installed railway cli stopped working. Had to remove, could not update. Did not work to install again. Tfw using Javascript based cli (cringe). Install rust version of railway cli. hackerman.exe. Re-link blog to my railway project for blog. Works first try. Railway up. OK, blog back online.

Now, the fan on my computer that I have the blog on seems to be broken or something, it is making noises like some kind of hellicopter or something (loud!). It is driving me crazy. So I need to move blog to another  computer. But I am having big problem updating the git repo where I have my blog. I do not understand git, except when it works i.e. I make a new repo and commit there and whatnot. I kind of know how to switch branches, but that is only on a good day. The spinning fan is very loud. I need to move blog to another computer because I can't stand this noise. But I can't update the git repo so then how can I clone it? Ugh... Maybe I will just use headphones whenever I need to update blog again I guess... Good news I guess is that my railway is working now again.
