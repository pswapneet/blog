      <description>2023 has been unusually productive so far! The fun work train just keeps on rollin&#39; (David Lynch reference, is he still on YouTube?) with no signs of derailment. Railway references aside, I have not been deploying on railway.app so far this year (well, I tried to deploy Flask there, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out how to get it to work), but rather on pythonanywhere.com. More on my dev projects later in the week, I want to start out the week with some good ol&#39; fashion meme posting, or whatever you call it.</description>

      <description>Hurry, need to make a post before 2022 is over! I know I said I was going to maintain this blog. I did not do that. Ok so thankfully this year is almost over since it has been quite bad for many reasons.
I have not been doing any web dev at all during the fall or winter. In fact I had to google how to make a post since I forgot ($ hugo new posts/nameofpost.</description>
