      <description>Sunday, Funday I keep working on it. There has been a lot happening in the AI/LLM space this past week as you all know, and I intend to use this to escape manual labor as much as possible. I know that it is possible, but one step at a time, so I have been doing some automation using Python and planning on how to proceed. More on that in the coming week, for now, I must sleep to get ready for another Manic Monday.</description>
