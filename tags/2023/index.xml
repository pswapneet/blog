      <description>Hurry, need to make a post before 2022 is over! I know I said I was going to maintain this blog. I did not do that. Ok so thankfully this year is almost over since it has been quite bad for many reasons.
I have not been doing any web dev at all during the fall or winter. In fact I had to google how to make a post since I forgot ($ hugo new posts/nameofpost.</description>
